You can learn how to use the CIM object space to get information and manage a server that runs VMware ESXi by studying these examples. Each example describes a goal to accomplish, steps to accomplish the goal, and a few lines of pseudocode to demonstrate the steps used in the client. These examples are chosen primarily to explain features of the VMware implementation of the profiles, and secondarily to demonstrate common operations.

Many of the examples build on the basic steps described in [Developing Client Applications for the CIM API](https://vdc-repo.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/f98d554a-3f1d-452c-bf5e-74b6e48ab37a/720b45cc-9f94-488d-90ed-e924134308ab/doc/GUID-9543F0BD-5622-471C-9A54-E6169DDF1649.html).
